# Survey Form üìù

This is my submission for freeCodeCamp's [Survey Form certification project!](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-survey-form-project/build-a-survey-form) It took about three hours of constant work to code and redesign.

I learned a lot about HTML forms while creating this project, most notably `<input>` types and attributes. I also learned how to create a popup alert in Javascript!
